Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) brings scripting languages to Android by allowing you to edit and execute scripts and interactive interpreters directly on the Android device. These scripts have access to many of the APIs available to full-fledged Android applications, but with a greatly simplified interface that makes it easy to get things done.

Scripts can be run interactively in a terminal, in the background, or via [Locale](http://www.androidlocale.com/). Python, Perl, JRuby, Lua, BeanShell, JavaScript, Tcl, and shell are currently supported, and we're planning to add more. See the [SL4A Video Help](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07A81E6CE96F158B) playlist on YouTube for various demonstrations of SL4A's features.

SL4A is designed for developers and is _alpha_ quality software. Please report bugs and feature requests on the [issues list](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/Issues?tm=3). You can download the current APK by scanning or clicking the following barcode:

<table border='0'><tr><td><a href='http://android-scripting.googlecode.com/files/sl4a_r6.apk'><img src='http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=200x200&chl=http://android-scripting.googlecode.com/files/sl4a_r6.apk&nonsense=something_that_ends_with.png' /></a></td><td><wiki:gadget url="http://www.ohloh.net/p/346315/widgets/project_users_logo.xml" height="43" border="0"/></td></tr></table>

To install SL4A, you will need to enable the "Unknown sources" option in your device's "Application" settings.

## What's Powered by SL4A? ##

Want to see SL4A in action? Check out some of these cool SL4A powered projects:

### Rockets ###

SL4A was used by the Nexus One payload for sensor logging. See the [article in Make](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/07/nexus_onearduino_smallsat_satellite.html) for more information about the project.

### Cellbots ###

We are a collection of hobbyists who want to free your cell phone from your pocket and let it connect and move with the real world. How? As a robot of course!

Cellbots arenâ€™t just about using your phone to control a robot (which is cool too), but we aim on making your phone be the robot. It already has touch, hearing, speech, vibration, and many more senses, but needs legs (or wheels) to finally be the free roaming robot it was born to be.

See the [Cellbots blog](http://www.cellbots.com/) or [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/cellbots) for more.

### Oplop ###

Using a single master password and various account names, one can create an infinite number of unique account passwords. These unique account passwords are commonly called password hashes, domain-specific passwords, or per-site passwords.

See the [Oplop](http://code.google.com/p/oplop/) project page for more information.

### Broadcast ###

Broadcast is an embedded web application for remote Android device management. Broadcast has four goals:

  * Remote monitoring:  Make Android state and device data available over a network.
  * Remote control:  Allow remote control of an Android device over a network.
  * Proof-of-concept:  Demonstrate that complex ruby applications can run in an  Android environment, even with constrained resources.
  * Framework:  Set the groundwork for a number of advanced applications.

See [the project homepage](http://github.com/mleone/broadcast/), this [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/panopticdev/broadcast-presentation), and this [screenshot](http://i52.tinypic.com/w9zfh4.jpg) for more information.

### SMS Merger ###

SMS Merger is an excellent example of what can be done with Python and the WebView API. SMS Merger is designed to send a series of personalized SMS. For example, to let Antony, Bob and Claire know which seat number they have been allocated for their exams, SMS Merger can turn a CSV file into the following SMS messages:

Dear Antony, your seat is A1
Dear Bob, your seat is M4
Dear Claire, your seat is M2
